## Output Examples

### Style Guide with Pondering
```markdown
<pondering>
Looking at these images, I'm seeing a design language that speaks to productivity 
and focus. The color choices lean heavily on calming blues and energizing greens, 
suggesting an app that wants to help users achieve a state of flow. The generous 
whitespace and clean typography indicate a desire to reduce cognitive load...
</pondering>

# YourApp Design System
